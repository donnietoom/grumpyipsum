                Today's forecast, grumpy with a 100% chance of throat punches. This girl is on fire, good let me get
                the marshmallows. Just go away, leave. I had fun once, it was awfull. Yep that's me, where is my
                oscar? Twinkle twinkle little star, I will hit you with my car. It's beginning to look a lot like,
                fuck this. Good morning? no such thing. Mike's projects are like his wife, they both suck balls.
                There's not enough coffee in the world to get me to rise and shine. Your design looks like someone
                tried to recreate a natural disaster, only yours is much worse. I'm listening, I just don't care.
                Free hugs, go hug a cactus. You must have been born on the highway, because thats where most
                accidents happen You're like a ray of sunshine, hurting peoples eyes and giving them skin disease.
                My bloodtype is be negative. This font looks pretentious and empty, just like you. There will be no
                easter bunny this year, I ate it. I love mondays, it makes people cry. This layout looks
                horrible.
